# Environment, and environment secrets only resolve inside a job that declares
# `environment:`.
#
# This fails the run instead of skipping the target the way publish-extension.yml
# does: an unpublished browser extension is a missing nice-to-have, a backend
# that silently did not deploy is a frontend talking to the wrong API.

# calling step's env.

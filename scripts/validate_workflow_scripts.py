"""Check that no workflow or composite action carries an embedded script, and that
.github/scripts/ agrees with them.

Shell inside a YAML string is invisible to every linter there is. Moving each
step body into .github/scripts/ is what lets the shellcheck hook see it at all
— so the convention has to hold, or it decays one pull request at a time. This
is the guard that stops that, in the style of the other drift checks beside it.

Four things are asserted:

1. No workflow or composite action has a multi-line ``run:``. A ``script:`` block (actions/
   github-script) is allowed only as a one-line ``require(...)`` loader.
2. Every ``.github/scripts/`` path one of them names exists on disk.
3. Every script under ``.github/scripts/`` is named by one of them — which
   catches the orphan a workflow edit leaves behind.

``.github/scripts/lib/`` is exempt from (3) and (4): it is sourced by other
scripts rather than invoked by a step, so no workflow names it and it carries
no shebang.
